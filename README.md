# etch_a_sketch

This is the Etch a Sketch Project from The Odin Project. I wanted to take a different approach and just see if I could create it first without referencing the instructions or hints, just go. I'll rely on my own skills and google-fu to implement:

- Changable Grid Amount
- On click etch a sketch fill
- Color Picker
- Eraser
- Clear Button

## Thoughts

Went well! Was difficult, but happy I finished it. It's a bit spaghetti codey, but I will come back later and fix it.
