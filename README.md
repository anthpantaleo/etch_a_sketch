# etch_a_sketch

This is the Etch a Sketch Project from The Odin Project. I wanted to take a different approach and just see if I could create it first without referencing the instructions. I'll rely on my own skills and google-fu to implement:

- Changable Grid Amount
- On click etch a sketch fill
- Color Picker
- Eraser
- Clear Button
- Maybe a Download Button to download the etch a sketch into a PDF or something? Not too sure how hard this part is.
